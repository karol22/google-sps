        Hi, mi name is Karol. I am a senior Computer Science student from Mexico. 
         My main interests are programming and mathematics. I love to build things 
         from scratch and learn new things. I want to develop something that helps 
         many people as well as bring technology to the youth of Mexico
      </p>

        I lived in different small towns and cities when I was a child and I had no idea what to do with my life. 
        Then, in 2010 I discovered math contests and started a romance with science and technology. 
        In 2015, I wrote my first code in C++ and after that I realized how amazing it would be to be a programmer. 
        I learned a little more, started with programming contests and in 2016 I got a full scholarship to study 
        Computer Science in an amazing college here in Mexico.
