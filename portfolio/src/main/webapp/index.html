        <p class = "introduction" >
            I am a senior Computer Science student from Mexico. 
            My main interests are programming and mathematics. I love to build things 
            from scratch and learn new things. I want to develop something that helps 
            many people as well as bring technology to the youth of Mexico.

                    I lived in different small towns and cities when I was a child and I had no idea what to do with my life. 
                    Then, in 2010 I discovered math contests and started a romance with science and technology. 
                    In 2015, I wrote my first code in C++ and after that I realized how amazing it would be to be a programmer. 
                    I learned a little more, started with programming contests and in 2016 I got a full scholarship to study 
                    Computer Science in a great college here in Mexico.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm in my last year of college and currently my favorite subject is Data Science because I love all the math that 
                    is involved. I'm also collaborating with a professor in a research project of bioinformatics, this is a new kind of 
                    challenge to me and if it ends well I'll share it with you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Besides college, I work part in a fintech startup of online loans. This is quite cool to me since it is like a mini bank and 
                    I can work everyday with people from different areas such as engineering, data science, marketing, etc. Thanks to
                    this job I have learned many web skills such as Ruby, Golang, Javascript and some frameworks.

                    Everyone in my family (specially my mom) loves cats. All of our cats were rescued and every time I go to my hometown 
                    I see a new one. This is a gallery of some of them.
